📄**Description**

An optician's shop, called “Cul d'Ampolla”, wants to digitize the management of customers and sales of glasses.

First of all, they want to know who is the supplier of each of the glasses. Specifically, they want to know each supplier's name, address (street, number, floor, door, city, zip code and country), telephone, fax, VAT number.

The following information is required for the glasses: The brand, the prescription of each glass, the type of frame (floating, horn or metallic), the color of the frame, the color of each glass and the price.

About the clients: Name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of registration.

When a new client arrives, the referring customer has to be informed as well in the DB, if there is one.

Our system will indicate which employee is responsible for each sold order. Define what day/time the sale is made.
